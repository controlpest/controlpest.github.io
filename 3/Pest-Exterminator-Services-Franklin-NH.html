<p>This approach describes using a range of mechanical or physical strategies for pest exclusion, trapping (sometimes similar to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
