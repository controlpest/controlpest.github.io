<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is considered as a cost-effective and ecologically benign pest control strategy preferably matched for both small and big farmers worldwide. When termites have entered a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they likewise damage paper, fabric, carpets and more.
