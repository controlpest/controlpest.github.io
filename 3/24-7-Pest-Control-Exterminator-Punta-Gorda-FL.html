Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been suggested as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al.

If your facility currently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be surprised to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact products and services.</p>
