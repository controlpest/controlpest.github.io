<p>Pest management requires a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used just after routine monitoring shows that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level. Numerous individual product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM indicates for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are available in limited areas.</p>
<p>Pests that follow a particular seasonal pattern can be managed by adjusting planting dates. The addition of insulation into the attic and walls of a structure can supply control of typical pests in addition to understood insulation benefits such a robust thermal envelope and acoustic sound cancelling residential or commercial properties. Identification of pest hazard warrants taking correct steps to eliminate hazardous pests, combining various approaches and eliminating the chemical control repercussions.</p>

Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about minimizing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management strategies are not able to keep an insect pest population below a financial limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Generally, the main aim of IPM programmes is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, originally established for agricultural pest management, IPM programs are now developed to encompass diseases, weeds, and other pests that might hinder the management objectives of sites such as commercial and residential structures, lawn and grass locations, and house and neighborhood gardens.</p>
