IPM methods consist of the introduction of predators and particular parasitoids (types of wasps that are internal parasites of other insects). The generic term pesticides" can use to a wide spectrum of chemicals, consisting of insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides, fungicides, biocides, and comparable chemicals.</p>
<p>Many newer pesticides are originated from plants or naturally occurring compounds (e.g.-- pyrethrum, nicotine and bug juvenile hormone analogues), however the toxophore or active component may be become provide increased biological activity or stability.
