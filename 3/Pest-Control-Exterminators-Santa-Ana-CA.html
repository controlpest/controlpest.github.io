<p>If left unattended, rodents can trigger terrible damage to your home and your family's health.

It needs a professional technique and tactical attack, which is exactly what you'll get when you employ help from Pest Control Solutions, Inc For instance, by including natural opponents as biological control agents in the management of pests, IPM professionals knew that more specific and less damaging chemicals would require to be utilized over the long run (Hoy, 1990; Hull et al., 1997).</p>
<p>IPM methods include both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest efficient dose when other methods of pest control have actually failed.

<h3>All Natural Pest Control Santa Ana California</h2>
<p>The approach to be chosen for IPM depends upon many aspects, the important of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial aspect of the management. Insect pests cause significant losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.

<p>A few of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, efficient against sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, efficient against red cotton bug, cutworms, grasshoppers; botanical mixes, combinations of extracts from different plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, cold, gliricidia, marigold, etc</p>
