<p>The resurgence of bed bugs has caused more than the weird little blood suckers to come out of the woodwork. We look at the big photo and focus on long term prevention of pests by carrying out pre-treatment evaluations, identifying conditions conducive to pests, de-webbing, positioning of monitoring devices, sanitation recommendations, prevention & exclusion, and using pesticides in a tactical and safe manner are all examples of how Mills PM carries out the practices of IPM.</p>
<p>Fifty seven of 66 broad spectrum pesticides used on rice at the time were prohibited by presidential decree (Morse & Buhler 1997).
