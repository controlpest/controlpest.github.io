We look at the big photo and focus on long term prevention of pests by carrying out pre-treatment evaluations, identifying conditions conducive to pests, de-webbing, positioning of monitoring devices, sanitation recommendations, prevention & exclusion, and using pesticides in a tactical and safe manner are all examples of how Mills PM carries out the practices of IPM.</p>
<p>Fifty seven of 66 broad spectrum pesticides used on rice at the time were prohibited by presidential decree (Morse & Buhler 1997).
