<p>A common pitfall most companies run into is explaining their business name too literally by using worn-out pest control terms like control, pesticide, management, and insecticide. The pest management market is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and roughly 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, bedbugs, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, flies and bees are frequently discovered pests in our society.</p>
