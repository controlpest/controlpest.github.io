<p>Pest management requires a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used only after regular monitoring shows that a pest population had reached an economic threshold level. Many private product growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM implies for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in restricted locations.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and dissuade pest determination include intercropping (multiple crops in the very same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household bug pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about reducing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management techniques are not able to keep an insect pest population below an economic limit, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Think about alternative approaches (aside from pesticides) to make your home and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from ending up being an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can endure pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a structure. Recent missions for efficient, safe, and enduring pest management programs have been targeted mostly toward advancement of new and much better products with which to replace conventional poisonous pesticides.</p>
