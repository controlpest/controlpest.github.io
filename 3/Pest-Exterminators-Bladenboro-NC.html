Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically specifically about reducing pesticide usage. If all other incorporated pest management strategies are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is justified.</p>
<p>On the other hand, insecticides that are more selective due to the fact that they are most efficient against insects with particular feeding habits, at certain life phases, or within specific taxonomic groups, are referred to as "biorational" pesticides. Established in 1967, it is the premier association of the expert pest management markets, with over 350 members throughout the country.</p>
