Pests seek out locations with an abundant food source, as well as a safe environment in which they can breed. Other relatively low-risk pesticides are offered for some pests. Inoculative biological control means releasing natural opponents occasionally or seasonally to restore a balance that has not been preserved naturally or has actually been disrupted by other control approaches.</p>
<p>The determination of the proper reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest.
