<p>The very best method to control pests is to make your house unappealing to them. However home pests can also be a threat to your household. When trying to find a place to infest, pests prefer to hide in a location that supplies food and a safe breeding place. Biological control is a lot easier to execute in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is caused therefore becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For instance, a wealthy neighborhood likely will have a lot of big, costly houses, so pest control expenses might be higher there because there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those homes.</p>
