<p>When pest issues are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are needed. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulas or its cry toxic substances in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>
