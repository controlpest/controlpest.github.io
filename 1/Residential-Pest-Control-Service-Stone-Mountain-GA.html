<p>The 4 major problems encountered with standard pesticides are hazardous residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest renewal (Lewis, 1997 ). Using natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more environmentally friendly are encouraged and artificial pesticides need to only be utilized as a last option or only used as required and typically only at particular times in a pests life cycle.</p>

Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
