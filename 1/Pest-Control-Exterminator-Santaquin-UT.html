<p>Tighter guidelines for food security, occupational health and safety, and the environment indicate internal pest control isn't a choice for many food organisations these days. Farmers are faced with myriad of production difficulties where the most common issues are pests, which include insects, illness, and weeds.

If we cultivate crops according to the concept of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), most researchers concur that this will be possible only.</p>
