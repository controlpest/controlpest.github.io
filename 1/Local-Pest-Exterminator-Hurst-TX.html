<p>Socio-psychological aspects including reasonable and ethical factors to consider were discovered to the motorists in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness event and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey carried out by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that a lack of certified IPM specialists and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM application in developed nations.</p>
<p>The determination of the appropriate reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides poisonous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect types or life stages.</p>
