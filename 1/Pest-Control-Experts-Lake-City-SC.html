<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, manage, and minimize danger from pests and pest management tools and methods in such a way that minimizes total financial, health, and environmental dangers.</p>
<p>In reference to the idea of incorporating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to accept coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest problems, classical biological control method is typically used where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been successfully used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>To develop and execute best practices of pest management in natural farming, it is also essential to have precise knowledge of crop and pest biology, ecology, phenology and of pest-crop interactions, while following strictly controlled rules of organic farming. There are lots of diy methods and treatments and best practices that anybody can follow to get rid of pests from his space.</p>
