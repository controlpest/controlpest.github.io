<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is considered as a environmentally benign and cost-effective  pest control technique ideally suited for both little and big farmers all over the world. Once termites have gone into a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more.

<p>It is found often that we require pest control just in a specific area and not everywhere. Our online courses consist of Crop Pest Diagnostics and Management, in addition to the first-ever web-based sanitary and phytosanitary measures curriculum (sponsored by USAID). Integrated pest management needs an understanding of the ecology of the cropping system, consisting of that of the pests, their natural enemies, and the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Kids are particularly vulnerable to hurt from pesticides, because their bodies and immune systems are still establishing. The Asia Pacific is projected to be the fastest-growing area from 2017 to 2023 due to the rigid requirement for commercial establishments and industrial sectors (such as food processing, food service markets, and tourist sectors) to adhere to pest control guidelines within their facilities.</p>
