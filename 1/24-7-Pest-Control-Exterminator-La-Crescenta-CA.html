<p>For some jobs, pest control workers use a mix of pest management techniques, a practice known as incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of regular assessments. Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and illness, though challenged by some as a valid measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the intensification of pest control.</p>
<p>Constant surveillance and monitoring of insect pests population is vital for assessment of damage and for identifying the requirements for actions to be taken.
