IPM intends to keep using pesticides and other types of intervention just to levels that are economically and environmentally warranted and which reduce or decrease risk to human health and the environment.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies a lot of the very same concepts as IPM but restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
