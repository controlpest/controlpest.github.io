<p>Physical and mechanical controls eliminate a pest directly, block pests out, or make the environment inappropriate for it. Traps for rodents are examples of mechanical control.

<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down advancement and feeding and go through greater parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). In other words, an effective, nondisruptive way to manage a moderate beet armyworm outbreak may be to retard its development and damage while offering the parasitoids time to work, thus enhancing the parasitoids' impact throughout subsequent generations.</p>
