<p>Having completed the MSc you will have the ability to recognize the underlying causes of major pest and illness problems and recognize financially important insects, plant illness and weeds. The NSW Department of Main Industries offers substantial information on IPM practices in broadacre cropping and in horticulture, including strategies for specific pest species and crops.</p>
<p>A strategy that includes using pest-resistant and pest-tolerant cultivars developed through conventional breeding or genetic engineering (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars have physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that lower the plant's attractiveness or suitability for the pest to feed, develop, or reproduce successfully.</p>
<p>Local pest control services use low-cost chemicals that only push back termites, triggering them to spread out further and trigger extensive damage to your property. By correcting the conditions that result in pest issues and using approved pesticides only when essential, IPM provides more reliable pest control while lowering pesticide use.
