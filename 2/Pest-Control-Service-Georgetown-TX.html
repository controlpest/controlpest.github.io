<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and prevent pest determination consist of intercropping (several crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
