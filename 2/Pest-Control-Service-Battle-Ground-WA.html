<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off because growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility currently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be surprised to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact products and services.</p>
<p>A pest specialist can help carry out a tailored Integrated Pest Management program for your business.

<p>On the other hand, organic food production applies a lot of the very same ideas as IPM however restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
