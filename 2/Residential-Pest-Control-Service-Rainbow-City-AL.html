<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly specifically about minimizing pesticide usage. If all other incorporated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population below a financial threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>If, after following organized and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use selected biopesticides with low ecological effect. Professional exterminators utilize different kinds of baits and pesticides to eliminate and remove pests. Effective, permanent corrective actions can then be required to avoid pests from getting in the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>
