The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) refers to pest control and avoidance programs that rely on several simultaneous techniques to obtain the desired result.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep an eye on for pests and recognize them properly, so that suitable control decisions can be made in conjunction with action limits.

Management choices need to be based on tracking and population levels of insect pests, as well as dependable thresholds.
