<p>Our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is based on our 4 principles that together we call ERDM. We understand that finding pests in your home or business is upsetting. Versatility and Time- The process of pest control takes some time and efforts. Pests are unwanted plants, animals, insects, bacteria or other organisms that interfere with human activity.</p>
<p>We are devoted to supplying green, eco-friendly pest services to our neighborhood in the greater Portland-Vancouver area. Only mix as much as you are going to use at one time if the pesticide need to be combined with water. A regular pest control treatment of manholes will help to keep those pests away. DAERA has established an Integrated Pest Management Guide to help farmers with understanding the requirements of IPM.</p>
<p>Consider alternative approaches (aside from pesticides) to make your house and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can endure pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a building. Recent quests for reliable, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted primarily towards advancement of new and better items with which to change traditional toxic pesticides.</p>
