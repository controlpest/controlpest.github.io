<p>The variety of plants examined will depend on factors such as the worth of the crop, potential issues and size and kind of greenhouses. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) integrates various types of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to conventional synthetic pesticides-- in a practical, long-term strategy. Biopesticides are typically suitable with natural enemies, however there are exceptions.</p>
<p>The success of control methods must be measured using signs based on tracking of damaging organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and influence on the environment. These consist of the renewal of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable effect on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
