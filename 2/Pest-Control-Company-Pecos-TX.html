Pest-resistant crops include potatoes bred to express hairy, sticky leaves that can trap and kill aphids.</p>
<p>Termites eat furniture, papers, books, and even files kept in lockers and safes, hence triggering gigantic damage within just a few months.

Classical biological control includes introducing natural opponents from a pest's native variety into a brand-new location where native natural opponents do not supply control.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and determine them precisely, so that suitable control choices can be made in combination with action thresholds. Nevertheless, the major pattern has been towards the use of modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to replace standard pesticides with less harmful chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; but these methods are still rehabs.</p>
