Pest-resistant crops include potatoes bred to express hairy, sticky leaves that can trap and kill aphids.</p>
<p>Termites eat furniture, papers, books, and even files kept in lockers and safes, hence triggering gigantic damage within just a few months.

Nevertheless, the major pattern has been towards the use of modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to replace standard pesticides with less harmful chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; but these methods are still rehabs.</p>
