The cornerstone of an effective IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and illness, though challenged by some as a valid procedure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>Each time the crop is hunted, record arthropod pest numbers, area within the greenhouse, and the number of plants checked. It's possible that the duplicated use of pesticides may be more harmful in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these limits change for changes in market value, stage of crop growth, expense of pesticides, etc., however in truth most are based upon repaired invasion or damage levels.</p>
