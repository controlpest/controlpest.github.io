<p>Fifty seven of 66 broad spectrum pesticides used on rice at the time were prohibited by presidential decree (Morse & Buhler 1997). In addition to the research and outreach foundation and the 4 components of management, aspects that influence rewarding, safe, and inexpensive food production at a bigger scale and their implications for worldwide food security should also be consisted of in an IPM model.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be extremely reliable in triggering substantial reductions in pest populations in certain circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural enemies or saving natural opponent populations by supplying sanctuaries or preventing practices that damage them are some of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
