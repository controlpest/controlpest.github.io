This combination of IGRs can be reliable in avoiding re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, might cause serious damage to structures, office furniture, artifacts and specimens. Applicators carry out more intricate tasks, are able to utilize a broader series of pesticides, and might concentrate on a certain location of pest control.</p>
