This combination of IGRs can be reliable in avoiding re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, might cause serious damage to structures, office furniture, artifacts and specimens. Applicators carry out more intricate tasks, are able to utilize a broader series of pesticides, and might concentrate on a certain location of pest control.</p>

IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure favourable economic condition, social and environmental consequences 13 and is applicable to the majority of farming, public health and amenity pest management scenarios.</p>
