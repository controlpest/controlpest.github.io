<h3>The Best Pest Control Southington CT 06489</h3>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies.

<p>In reference to the idea of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later widened to accept collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
